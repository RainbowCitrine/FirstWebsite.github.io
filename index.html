        <p id="p1">Hello, my name is Noah Rainbow! Welcome to the very first website I have built with HTML and CSS hehe. I currently enrolled in the web development series in my community college and I feel like I have already learned so much from just one class meeting! Allow me to tell you a bit about myself, I am currently a computer science major who hopes to achieve the goal of one day exploring most topics of computer science whether it be from programming, infrastructure technology, cloud computing, and of course web development. I am currently certified in C++ programming, object oriented programming, and currently pursuing an associates of science in computer programming as well as an associates of arts in information technology. I guess a fun fact would be I am also trying to achieve an associates in mathematics haha even though I can sometimes not be a huge fun LOL. Either way I hope to earn my certification in web development by spring semester of 2023. <br> <br>Thank you for reading <3 </p>

        <h1 id="CSCI">CSCI 145</h1>
            <p id="CSP">This class mainly teaches Java, however this semester might be a different because we are learning GUI with javafx rather than normal java syntax. It will be an interesting change considering I love coding in normal syntax since I did start in a language that was very strict on syntax (C++).  You can go ahead and follow my progress in this course by clicking the button down below! There you will be directed to my repository hehe! </p>
